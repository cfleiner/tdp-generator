# Team Design Pattern Generator

The website serves two purposes:

* Providing a website to easily generate TDP diagrams to lower the entrance barrier to get started with the visual notation proposed by Van Diggelen and Johnson (2019).
* Displaying supplementary material of the analysis results of the visual notation that were presented as a poster (DOI will be added as soon as available) at the Conference on Human-Agent Interaction (HAI 2023).
